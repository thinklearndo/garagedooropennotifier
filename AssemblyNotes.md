# Assembly Notes

## Soldering on the voltage regulators
There are two voltage regulators. One provides 3.3v to the Holtek HT68F001 microcontroller, (U2), and the other provides 3.3v to the NodeMCU, with an enable switch (U1).

Solder the MCP1825 voltage regulator into the U1 spot.

Solder the MCP1700 voltage regulator into the U2 spot. The solder mask matches the orientation for the part.

Solder the Capacitors into the C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 spots. Make sure to orient them correctly. They are polarized and if put in backwards, they will explode.

There is a white line on one side of the capacitor that shows the negative pin. That pin goes into the hole that has the white half of the circle. See the following picture for an example of the capacitor inserted correctly. The arrow shows the white line on the capacitor showing the negative pin.

There is also a positive mark on the board next to each capacitor circle. That is where the positive pin should be inserted.
