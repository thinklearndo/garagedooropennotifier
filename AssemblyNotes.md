# Assembly Notes

## Soldering on the voltage regulators
There are two voltage regulators. One provides 3.3v to the Holtek HT68F001 microcontroller, (U2), and the other provides 3.3v to the NodeMCU, with an enable switch (U1).

Solder the MCP1825 voltage regulator into the U1 spot.

Solder the MCP1700 voltage regulator into the U2 spot. The solder mask matches the orientation for the part.
